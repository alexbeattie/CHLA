# üîî Deployment Notification Setup

You now have 3 options for deployment notifications. Choose one or more:

## Option 1: GitHub Issue Comments (Easiest - No Setup!)
**‚úÖ This works immediately without any configuration!**

1. Create an issue in your repo titled "Deployment Status"
2. Add the label `deployment-status` to it
3. Every deployment will add a comment with:
   - ‚úÖ Success or ‚ùå Failure status
   - Links to live sites
   - Timestamp and who triggered it

## Option 2: Email Notifications

1. **For Gmail:**
   ```
   EMAIL: your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_USERNAME: your-email@gmail.com
   EMAIL_PASSWORD: your-app-specific-password
   ```
   
   **Important**: Use an [App-Specific Password](https://support.google.com/accounts/answer/185833) for Gmail, not your regular password.

2. **How to add secrets:**
   - Go to your GitHub repo ‚Üí Settings ‚Üí Secrets and variables ‚Üí Actions
   - Click "New repository secret"
   - Add each secret

## Option 3: Slack Notifications
