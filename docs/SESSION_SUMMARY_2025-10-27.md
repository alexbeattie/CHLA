# Session Summary: October 27, 2025

## ‚úÖ What We Accomplished Today

### 1. Fixed Provider Loading Based on ZIP Code
**Problem**: App was loading 100+ providers in 50-mile radius
**Solution**: Now loads ~25 providers based on user's ZIP code via Regional Center endpoint

**Changes**:
- Created `getUserZipCode()` method using browser geolocation
- Changed mounted() to use `providerStore.searchByZipCode(zipCode)`
- Falls back to 25-mile radius search if no ZIP found
- Uses `/api/providers-v2/by_regional_center/` endpoint

### 2. Removed "Regional Center" as Insurance/Filter Type
**Problem**: Code treated Regional Centers as a payment/funding type
**Solution**: Removed all "Accepts Regional Center" filter logic

**Changes**:
- Removed checkbox from FilterPanel.vue
- Removed `acceptsRegionalCenter` from filterStore.ts interface
- Removed `params.insurance = 'regional center'` logic
- Updated onboarding filter application

### 3. Created Comprehensive Documentation
**REGIONAL_CENTERS_CONCEPT.md** (155 lines):
- Explains Regional Centers are GEOGRAPHIC, not financial
- 21 in California, 7 in LA County
- ZIP code determines RC automatically
- This is the PRIMARY purpose of the app

**MAPVIEW_CLEANUP_PLAN.md** (377 lines):
- Detailed cleanup strategy for 6,997-line MapView.vue
- Identifies ~2,500 lines of dead code
- Outlines what to keep vs remove
- Est. 8-12 hours for full cleanup

### 4. Added Regional Center Legend
**Created RegionalCenterLegend.vue**:
- Shows all 7 LA County Regional Centers with color coding
- Highlights user's matched RC
- Positioned in bottom-left of map
- Clear message: "Your Regional Center: [Name]"
- Reinforces that RCs are ZIP-based, not a choice

**Color Scheme**:
- San Gabriel/Pomona: Red
- Harbor: Blue
- North LA County: Green
- Eastern LA: Orange
- South Central LA: Purple
- Westside: Pink
- Frank D. Lanterman: Teal

## üéØ Core Application Flow (NOW CORRECT)

```
1. User visits app
2. Browser geolocation requested
3. Reverse geocode to get ZIP code
4. ZIP ‚Üí Regional Center lookup
5. Load ~25 providers for that RC
6. Display:
   - Map with provider markers
   - RC polygon overlay
   - RC Legend (highlighting user's RC)
   - Provider list
7. User can search by different ZIP/address
```

**Key Point**: Regional Center is AUTOMATIC based on ZIP, not selected

## ‚ö†Ô∏è The MapView.vue Problem

**Current State**: 6,997 lines
**Target State**: ~3,500-4,000 lines

**The Issue**:
MapView.vue has become untenable. It contains:
- ‚úÖ New orchestration methods (KEEP)
- ‚úÖ Onboarding flow management (KEEP)
- ‚úÖ Authentication (KEEP)
- ‚úÖ Layout/navigation (KEEP)
- ‚úÖ Regional Center data fetching (KEEP)
- ‚ùå Old map initialization (~1,700 lines - REMOVE)
- ‚ùå Old marker rendering (~300 lines - REMOVE)
- ‚ùå Old search methods (~150 lines - REMOVE)
- ‚ùå Old filter methods (~200 lines - REMOVE)
- ‚ùå Old data properties (~150 lines - REMOVE)

**Why We Can't Just Delete**:
Some "old" methods are still called by onboarding flow:
- `initializeAfterOnboarding()` calls `initMap()`
- `detectUserLocation()` calls `initMap()`
- These need to be refactored to use MapCanvas, not just deleted

---

## üöß Next Steps (In Priority Order)

### IMMEDIATE (1-2 hours)
**Map Dead Code Analysis**:
1. Create a comprehensive list of methods in MapView.vue
2. Mark each as:
   - ACTIVE (being used)
   - DEAD (not being called)
   - ONBOARDING (only used by onboarding flow)
   - UNCERTAIN (need to verify)
3. For ONBOARDING methods: refactor to use new components instead of old initMap()

### SHORT TERM (4-6 hours)
**Systematic Cleanup**:
1. Start with obviously dead methods (not called anywhere)
2. Remove in small batches
3. Test after each removal
4. Verify onboarding still works

**Safe Removals** (high confidence):
- Old map event handlers (if MapCanvas handles them)
- Duplicate utility methods
- Commented-out code
- Unused computed properties

### MEDIUM TERM (8-12 hours)
**Refactor Onboarding Integration**:
1. Update `initializeAfterOnboarding()` to use MapCanvas
2. Remove `initMap()` entirely
3. Remove `updateMarkers()` entirely
4. Clean up old data properties

**Expected Result**: ~4,000 lines (from 6,997)

## üìù Key Learnings

### 1. Regional Centers Concept is Now Clear
‚úÖ Geographic service areas (not funding)
‚úÖ ZIP-based assignment (automatic)
‚úÖ PRIMARY app purpose
‚úÖ Documented thoroughly

### 2. Component Architecture is Good
‚úÖ 6 components built and working
‚úÖ 3 Pinia stores managing state
‚úÖ Clean separation of concerns
‚úÖ 453 tests passing (97.9%)

### 3. MapView Cleanup is Critical
‚ö†Ô∏è Can't ignore the 6,997-line monster
‚ö†Ô∏è Need systematic approach
‚ö†Ô∏è Must preserve onboarding
‚ö†Ô∏è Can't just mass-delete

### 4. Documentation Prevents Re-confusion
‚úÖ REGIONAL_CENTERS_CONCEPT.md locks in understanding
‚úÖ MAPVIEW_CLEANUP_PLAN.md provides roadmap
‚úÖ Code comments explain "why"

---

## üéì What We WON'T Forget Again

### 1. Regional Centers ARE:
- Geographic service areas
- Assigned by ZIP code
- Automatically determined
- The MAIN app purpose

### 2. Regional Centers are NOT:
- Insurance/payment types
- User-selectable filters
- Funding sources
- Optional features

### 3. Development Priorities:
1. FIRST: Core ZIP ‚Üí RC ‚Üí Providers flow
2. SECOND: Onboarding experience
3. THIRD: Additional filters (insurance, therapy, etc.)
4. LAST: Code cleanup (once functionality works)

## üéØ Tomorrow's Focus

1. **Create Method Inventory** for MapView.vue
2. **Mark Dead vs Active** code
3. **Start Safe Removals** (~500-1,000 lines)
4. **Test Thoroughly** after each removal
5. **Preserve Onboarding** at all costs

**Goal**: Get MapView.vue under 5,000 lines without breaking anything
