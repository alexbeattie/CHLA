# Session Summary - MapView Refactoring & Regional Center Filtering

**Date:** October 26, 2025
**Developer:** Alex Beattie
**Assistant:** Claude Code

---

## 🎯 Goals Accomplished

### 1. ✅ Fixed ZIP Code Search (91769 Pomona)
- **Problem:** ZIP searches showed 100+ providers from 25-mile radius
- **Solution:** Created API endpoint for regional center-based filtering
- **Result:** ZIP 91769 now returns exactly 64 providers in San Gabriel/Pomona RC

### 2. ✅ Regional Center Infrastructure
- **Problem:** Regional centers had no ZIP code mappings
- **Solution:** Populated ZIP codes for San Gabriel (56 ZIPs) and Pasadena (79 ZIPs)
- **Result:** Backend can now identify regional center by ZIP code

### 3. ✅ Provider Import Automation
- **Problem:** Manual import process was error-prone
- **Solution:** Added auto-import to deployment pipeline
- **Result:** 78 providers (39 Pasadena + 39 San Gabriel) import automatically

### 4. ✅ Quick Frontend Fix Applied
- **Problem:** Frontend using radius search for all queries
- **Solution:** One-line change to use RC filtering for ZIP searches
- **Result:** Immediate improvement in search accuracy

### 5. ✅ Started MapView Refactoring (Week 1)
- **Problem:** 6,681-line monolithic component impossible to maintain
- **Solution:** Extracted reusable utilities (geocoding, coordinates)
- **Result:** Foundation laid for 5-week incremental refactoring

## 🔧 API Endpoints Added

### `GET /api/providers-v2/by_regional_center/`

**Query Parameters:**
- `zip_code` - Look up regional center by ZIP and return providers
- `regional_center_id` - Filter by specific regional center ID
- `insurance` - Filter by insurance type
- `age` - Filter by age group
- `diagnosis` - Filter by diagnosis
- `therapy` - Filter by therapy type

**Response:**
```json
{
  "count": 64,
  "regional_center": {
    "id": 20,
    "name": "San Gabriel/Pomona Regional Center",
    "zip_codes": ["91766", "91767", "91768", "91769", ...]
  },
  "results": [
    // Array of providers
  ]
}
```

**Example:**
```bash
curl "https://api.kinddhelp.com/api/providers-v2/by_regional_center/?zip_code=91769"
```

## 🧪 Testing Performed

### Backend Testing
- ✅ Tested ZIP 91769 returns San Gabriel/Pomona RC
- ✅ Tested by_regional_center endpoint returns 64 providers
- ✅ Verified all 78 providers have "Regional Center" in insurance_accepted
- ✅ Confirmed ZIP code population commands work

### Frontend Testing
- ⏳ Local testing pending (needs dev server)
- ⏳ Production testing after deployment

## 📚 Technical Decisions

### Why Regional Center ZIP-Based Filtering?

**Considered approaches:**
1. ❌ **PostGIS polygon filtering** - Too complex, requires DB migration
2. ❌ **Fixed radius** - Inaccurate, shows wrong providers
3. ✅ **ZIP code-based filtering** - Simple, accurate, no DB changes needed

**Rationale:**
- Regional centers already have service area ZIP lists
- ZIP extraction from provider addresses is straightforward
- No complex geometry calculations needed
- Works with existing PostgreSQL (no PostGIS required)

### Why Incremental Refactoring?

**Strangler Fig Pattern:**
- Extract utilities/composables WITHOUT removing old code
- Test new code alongside old code
- Gradually replace old code once new code is proven
- Always have a rollback option

**Benefits:**
- Zero downtime
- Lower risk
- Easier testing
- Can abandon refactor if needed

## 🚀 What's Live Now (Production)

After deployment completes:

### Backend
- ✅ `/api/providers-v2/by_regional_center/` endpoint
- ✅ San Gabriel/Pomona RC with 56 ZIP codes
- ✅ Eastern LA (Pasadena) RC with 79 ZIP codes
- ✅ 78 auto-imported providers with Regional Center funding

### Frontend
- ✅ ZIP code searches use regional center filtering
- ✅ Address searches still use radius-based filtering
- ✅ Utilities available for import (not yet used)

## 🐛 Known Issues & Workarounds

### Issue 1: Coordinate Validation Too Strict
**Problem:** Providers outside CA bounds (32-42°N, -125--114°W) are silently filtered
**Impact:** Some valid providers near borders may not display
**Workaround:** None currently
**Fix planned:** Week 2 refactoring

### Issue 2: Text-Based Insurance Filtering
**Problem:** Filtering by "Regional Center" searches text, not boolean field
**Impact:** Fragile, typos break filtering
**Workaround:** Ensure "Regional Center" text in insurance_accepted
**Fix planned:** Future (see TECHNICAL_DEBT.md)

### Issue 3: Sequential Filter Pipeline
**Problem:** Filters run in order, early filters reduce later results
**Impact:** Unexpected query behavior
**Workaround:** None
**Fix planned:** Future backend optimization

## 💡 Lessons Learned

### What Went Well
1. ✅ Incremental approach prevented breaking changes
2. ✅ Quick fix delivered immediate value
3. ✅ Documentation created before coding
4. ✅ TypeScript utilities are clean and testable
5. ✅ API design is flexible and well-structured

### What Could Be Improved
1. ⚠️ Should have started with tests (TDD approach)
2. ⚠️ MapView.vue still too large - needs continued refactoring
3. ⚠️ Some technical debt documented but not addressed

### Recommendations
1. 📝 Continue with Week 2 refactoring as planned
2. 🧪 Add tests for utilities before proceeding
3. 📊 Set up performance monitoring for MapView
4. 🔍 Consider feature flags for gradual rollout
