# 📱 Mobile Controls Fix - Complete!

## ✅ What Was Fixed

1. **Mobile navigation bar** - Now visible for ALL users (logged in or not)
2. **Hamburger menu button** - Available to everyone
3. **Search button** - Available to everyone
4. **User menu** - Only shows when logged in (this makes sense)

## 🔧 Changes Made

### MapView.vue modifications:
1. Removed `isAuthenticated` requirement from navbar visibility
2. Removed `isAuthenticated` requirement from mobile search bar
3. Kept user menu button only for authenticated users
4. Removed CSS that was hiding navbar for unauthenticated users

### Code Changes:
```vue
<!-- Before -->
<nav class="top-navbar" v-show="!showOnboarding && isAuthenticated">

<!-- After -->
<nav class="top-navbar" v-show="!showOnboarding">
```
