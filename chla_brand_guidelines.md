## Logo Usage

### Primary Logo
The primary logo is designed to be energetic, strong and readable. It should be used in all cases when the materials produced are for an external audience (ads, brochures, website, etc.) as well as for all internal purposes. The former tagline ("We Treat Kids Better") and rainbow color bar have been discontinued and should **not** be incorporated.

**Specifications:**
- Minimum logo size: 0.375" (3/8")
- Centering: Please visually center the logo using the center point of "Los Angeles"

**Specifications:**
- Minimum logo size: 0.1875" (3/16")

### Butterfly Icon
As the brand continues to grow so does the use of the butterfly icon. One day, we hope it will be able to fly on its own, but it is not there yet.

### Photographing Children
- Always try to capture the full child, including the expression on the child's face and in his or her eyes
- Avoid showing only parts of the child (hands and feet)

- Non-patients should be photographed wearing bright and vibrant colors
- Avoid prominent logo placement or busy patterns

### Photographing Hospital Staff
- If photographing nurses, doctors, researchers or other administrative employees, remove all badges if appropriate
- Make sure either business attire or lab coats are worn
- Avoid prominent logo placement or busy patterns

### Legal Requirements
- When photographing patients, we must have parents or guardians sign a patient consent form
- When photographing non-patients, we must have parents or guardians sign a non-patient media release form
- All forms must be explained and collected by trained CHLA staff

## Writing Style

### Our Name
Our official name is **Children's Hospital Los Angeles** and should be referred to as such in all written materials on first reference. The hospital may be referred to as **"CHLA"** in subsequent references in the same piece.

### Our Voice
CHLA's public voice strives to create clear, concise content that meets the intended goals of the piece, while working to tailor our voice to specific audiences.

**Audience-Specific Guidelines:**
- **Patient-family education materials:** Written in a conversational tone (as close as possible to a fourth-grade reading level), and always translated into Spanish
- **Content for physicians:** Can be more technical
- **Content for potential consumers or donors:** Can show more depth
- **Social media posts:** Can be more playful

**Voice Principles:**
- We want a voice that touches and affects every audience
- Use language and tone that relates to a layperson while also being meaningful to a medical professional
- We don't talk up or down; we talk across
- We can be intelligent without being dense, clever without being pretentious, and straightforward without being simplistic

### Writing Style Guide
A comprehensive writing style guide has been developed for all written public communications, including ads, brochures, posters and more. The writing style guide can be found at **InsideCHLA.org/MarCom**.
