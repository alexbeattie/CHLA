# ðŸ”§ GitHub Actions Fixes Applied

## Fixed Issues

### 1. Backend Health Check URL (502 Error)
**Problem**: The workflow was checking `/api/` which doesn't exist
**Fix**: Changed to `/api/regional-centers/` which is a valid endpoint

### 2. Deployment Warm-up Time
**Problem**: Backend needs time to warm up after deployment
**Fix**: Added retry logic - tries 3 times with 20-second waits

### 3. S3 Bucket for Deployment
**Problem**: Missing S3_BUCKET_NAME secret was causing issues
**Fix**: Use the default Elastic Beanstalk S3 bucket directly

### 4. Frontend Check
**Problem**: CloudFront check could fail if cache is still updating
**Fix**: Made it non-fatal - logs error but continues

## What This Means

Your GitHub Actions deployment will now:
- âœ… Check the correct backend URL
- âœ… Retry if the backend is still warming up
- âœ… Continue even if CloudFront is slow to update
- âœ… Still notify you of success/failure

## Next Steps

1. Commit these fixes:
   ```bash
   git add .github/workflows/deploy.yml
   git commit -m "Fix GitHub Actions deployment health checks"
   git push origin main
   ```

2. The deployment should now work properly!

## If You Still Get 502 Errors

The backend might actually be down. Check:
```bash
eb health --profile personal --region us-west-2
```

And redeploy manually if needed:
```bash
cd maplocation
eb deploy --profile personal --region us-west-2
```
